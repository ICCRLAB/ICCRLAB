   <b> SESSION DESCRIPTION: </b><br>
<pre>
The objective of this conference is to bring together the researchers, scientists, and scholars
across the globe who have been working and are interested to learn and share their wisdom
acquired in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Artificial Intelligence is at
the core of every strategic discussion that happens today in the corner office. 2016 has been the
year of some startling moves in Artificial Intelligence, such as driverless cars, virtual agents,
employee assistance, and chatbots, to name a few. In the years to come, we are inevitably going
to experience Artificial Intelligence and robotics in our everyday life. This is an indication of
the upcoming radical changes in the way we look at real-world problems. This special session
will focus on all aspects of issues that can be easily solved by using Machine learning
techniques and Artificial Intelligence techniques.
</pre>
