Due to bulk deployment of BSF personnel in far flung border area, militancy and Naxal affected areas, the majority of the force personnel stay separated from their families and are unable to look after the proper education of their wards. RJIT established with the objective of giving an opportunity to the children of BSF/CAPFs personnel as well as civilians to acquire quality technical education. This institute was inaugurated on 2nd October 1999 by Padma Vibhushan Shri K F Rustamji himself.

The founding father of BSF as its first Director General , Late Shri KF Rustamji always had the larger interest of the troops deep in his heart. He always felt that the BSF personnel deployed in remote areas and those who laid down their lives in honor of the country, their wards should be cared for proper education facilities.

Sh E N Ram Mohan, the then DG ,BSF assigned the task to Dr GP Bhatnagar, the then IG/Director BSF Academy and Sh Mahabir Prasad, DC the then Commandant CSMT to work on dreams of Shri Rustamji by establishing first ever engineering institute by a Para Military force in India with limited available resources.

Initially the Institute was established temporarily at CSMT and later on shifted to its allocated land near by CSMT.</p>
