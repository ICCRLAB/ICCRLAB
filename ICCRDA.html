ICCRDA-2020 moved from Physical mode to Digital (Virtual) mode due to Pandemic COVID-19. The conference was able to attract a diverse range of engineering practitioners, academicians, scholars, and industry delegates, with the reception of abstracts including more than 1200 authors from different parts of the world. The committee of professionals dedicated towards the conference is striving to achieve a high quality technical program with nine different tracks on Inventive Computing, Big data, Data Analytics and Research, Recent trends in IT, Machine learning and Internet of Things. All the tracks chosen in the conference are interrelated and are very famous among present day research community. Therefore, a lot of research is happening in the above-mentioned tracks and their related sub-areas. More than 300 full-length papers have been received, among which the contributions are focused on theoretical, computer simulation-based research, and laboratory-scale experiments. Amongst these manuscripts, 129 papers have been included in the IOP [Material Science and Engineering] proceedings after a thorough two-stage review and editing process. All the manuscripts submitted to the ICCRDA-2020 were peer-reviewed by at least two independent reviewers, who were provided with a detailed review proforma. The comments from the reviewers were communicated to the authors, who incorporated the suggestions in their revised manuscripts. The recommendations from two reviewers were taken into consideration while selecting a manuscript for inclusion in the proceedings. It is an exalting experience to finally see these elite contributions materialize into book volume as ICCRDA-2020 proceedings by IOP entitled “International Conference on Computational Research and Data Analytics”. </div>
